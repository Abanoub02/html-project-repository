<h1>How can I submit a site for consideration?</h1>
<br><h2>You can submit a site by clicking here.</h2><br>
<h1>I submitted a site but it hasn't appeared - why?</h1>
<br><h2>siteInspire receives over 200 subsmissions per day so
<br> it unfortunately it is impossible to feature every site,<br>
 so we have to limit the number of posts</h2>.<br>
<h1>How do you decide which sites get featured?</h1>
<br><h2>We look for cleanliness and simplicity without excessve
<br> gimmicks or decoration. Sites that use Flash unnecessarily
<br> won't be featured (though appropriate Flash sites are not excluded).
<br> Sites that force the browser's size will not be accepted. Sites with
 <br>broken images or obvious visual errors won't be featured (because we can't
 <br>take a nice screenshot). Also, sites that feature "award ribbons" are not
 <br>featured (because award ribbons are a quick way to make a site ugly).
<br>Some of the sites you feature are really hard to use, or don't work in my browser</h2>
.<h1> Why have you featured it?</h1>
<br><h2>Not every site featured is perfect and some might even contain errors, but we hope
 <br>all are interesting and push the boundaries of visual design and interaction.</h2>
<h1>Can I pay you to feature my site?</h1>
<br><h2>No - none of the features have been paid for.</h2>
<h1>Do you feature themes/templates?</h1>
<br><h2>Not yet but a new section will appear soon dedicated to themes and templates.
<br> You can already choose to submit themes.</h2>
