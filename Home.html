Sport includes all forms of competitive physical activity or games<br>
 which,[1] through casual or organized participation, at least in part aim to<br>
 use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to
<br> participants, and in some cases, entertainment for spectators.[2] Sports can 
<br>bring positive results to one's physical health. Hundreds of sports exist, from
<br> those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous
<br> participants, either in teams or competing as individuals. In certain sports such
<br> as racing, many contestants may compete, simultaneously or consecutively, with one
<br> winner; in others, the contest (a match) is between two sides, each attempting to
<br> exceed the other. Some sports allow a "tie" or "draw", in which there is no single
<br> winner; others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner and one loser.
<br> A number of contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion. Many 
<br>sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season,<br>
 followed in some cases by playoffs.
